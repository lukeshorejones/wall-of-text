# The Wall of Text
A plaintext dump of all human knowledge (and then some). Sort of. Not really. The Wall of Text is a very long paragraph. Each line is 140 characters long, and contains characters from a set of 95. The Wall is made up of every possible such line, meaning there are 75<sup>140</sup> lines of text. You can print a chosen number of lines from a chosen starting line, or you can get for the line number of any word, phrase or sentence(s) you can think of (under 140 characters).

Of course, the Wall of Text isn't actually stored anywhere. The trick to it is detailed in my blog post [here](https://lukeshorejones.com/blog/2019/10/01/wall-of-text-v1.0/).
